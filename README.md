## Analysis of Nasal Epithelium in Smokers and Non-Smokers

#Project Overview
This analysis explores the gene expression profiles of nasal epithelium samples from cigarette smokers and non-smokers using publicly available data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), specifically from the dataset titled "Cigarette smoking effect on the nasal epithelium" (GDS3309). The analysis highlights how smoking affects gene expression in nasal epithelial cells, extending the concept of a smoking-induced "field of injury" beyond the lungs to the nasal passage.

The primary goal is to compare the expression of seven genes across samples from current smokers and non-smokers, perform data normalization, and generate heatmaps for visualization.
